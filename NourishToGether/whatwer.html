   <p>  There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet. Yet as many
    as 783 million people still go hungry every day Of those 828 million, the World Food Program estimates that over
    40% are facing acute levels of hunger Even if we rebound from the economic fallout of the pandemic, the UN
    predicts that weâ€™ll fall well short of our goal for Zero Hunger by 2030. At the end of this decade, it estimates
    there will still be 670 million people facing hunger.</p>
